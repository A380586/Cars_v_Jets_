# Cars_v_Jets_
Cpmvolutioal neural Network by my own to classify between image of  Cars and jets
____________________________
Why did I buld this project?
____________________________

I buld this project to train a neral network to classcifi image of Cars and Jets. The Reason why I chose car and jets  was since i was a baby  i like cars and jets
___________________________
What Problem does it solve?
__________________________

this convolutional neural network differenciates between Cars and Jets


_____________________________________________
what i have learned while doing this project
_____________________________________________

i understand basic neural network code And about different libraries such as tensorflow and keras


_____________________________________________________________
how did you collect the data/where did you get the data from
_____________________________________________________________

I search Google image beacuse it was easy to find pictures of cars and jets


___________________________________________________
talk about how good your machine learning model is
___________________________________________________
 It very good
